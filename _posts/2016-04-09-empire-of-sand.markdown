Gazing upon the world,<br />
confident in the mastery of their domain,<br />
they see those without their sand and wonder,<br />
do they not see our empire of sand?

Unable to resist the pull of knowing,<br />
an emissary is sent from the empire of sand,<br />
to meet the empire without.

With an unsure start, the emissary of sand blurts, <br />
"What do you build from"?<br />
The without respond,<br />
"We build with hearts",<br />
the emissary of sand understands: the empire of hearts.<br />

The without from the empire of hearts asks,<br />
"May we exchange some of your sand for our hearts"?<br />
the sand emissary presents a fist of sand,<br />
the without gently uncover the heart to exchange.<br />

"A magnificent exchange, the empire of sand will be pleased"<br />
the without look upon the empire of sand's most mighty gift,<br />
"What might we do with this, we can not build more with your sand".<br />

The emissary of sand hurriedly draws diagrams in the sand,<br />
"You visit each other with these, talk to each other with that, and live together in this",<br />
the empire of hearts looks doubtful,<br />
"We do these things. How do you build with one another"?<br />
the emissary without does not understand this empire of hearts.<br />

The emissary without asks directly,<br />
"You claim to have what our empire of sand has, yet I see no such creations"<br />
The empire of hearts solemnly responds,<br />
"We see things as they are,<br />
peering inside reveals your sand is without"<br />

The emissary returns without,<br />
having felt the radiant warmth of the heart,<br />
having seen through its translucent flesh,<br />
having without the heart of ones own to hold the memory full,<br />
The emissary feels nothing,<br />
having returned to the mighty empire of nothing.
