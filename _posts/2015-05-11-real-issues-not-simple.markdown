No issue worth talking about is simple. Why would it be? Our world isn't simple. People have more than one trait, more than one "stereotype" that applies to them. So why should topics or events or issues be any different?

Why does it seem that many want to turn to the first simple answer they hear? Why is it that simple steps, and simple rules, or simple "fixes" are so alluring? What about them makes people latch on to those analogies which just "fit so perfectly" and make so much sense?

Because otherwise one would need to admit they don't know. They don't know the best solution, they don't know the best policy, they don't know all the effects it will have, or why. They don't know enough about the world to have a completely informed opinion. That real solutions are complex, that real "fixes" can sometimes take decades or centuries, when talking about social issues.

And that terrifies some people. Its absolutely scary to admit you just plain don't know what is best for your future, or your children, or your aging grandparents. Or your children's future. Or what is best for you *right now*. How can you make the decisions required of you in a fully informed capacity, when the time requirements to commit to a decision are vanishingly small? The answer may be that one doesn't. That instead some decisions are left not made, or unmade, for lack of enough resources to evaluate all possible options.

So what can we do about it? Well, having more time and resources to just always make the best decision is, quite frankly, mathematically impossible. Not that I mean we don't have enough resources or time, but even if we had all of it, we wouldn't arrive at the best decisions.

Its instead more important that we recognize that decisions, issues, and their resolutions aren't perfect. Their implementation, their execution, and their philosophy will change as time moves on. We may choose less optimal choices to instead focus on the more difficult problems of transitions between steps.

This isn't really a call to technocracy, despite how it may seem like the setup to one. Rather, its to get people to examine issues as more than skeletons, and to really examine the scars, and bumps, and odd features that are part of every issue, and every person.
