Piddling along and centuries passed, humanity wondered<br />
Could the stars Beyond home ever be within reach?<br />
Magneto-plasma rockets and thorium reactors just not enough<br />
Not enough to reach out

At last, the ceremony was announced<br />
From Mercury to the moons of Jupiter, all was captivated<br />
By a single broadcast<br />
A single hope realized in material form

A grand project and massive scale, no expense spared<br />
What couldn't be beyond our grasp?<br />
A 15 kilometer solar array in geo-orbit above Mercury<br />
To absorb a mighty but minuscule offering from our diligent Sun

This golden-bright shell of heat and light<br />
Converted to antimatter in tiny amounts<br />
Fired from electromagnetic turrets towards Earth<br />
Captured and stored in magnetic traps for fuel

New ship designs and plans to distant worlds, quickly realized<br />
No longer content, why might we stay here?<br />
The universe was within reach<br />
Humanity looked outwards no longer envious, but determined

Looking back upon our humble home system<br />
Gazing upon the night sky, a clear view of Mercury<br />
A captivating sight like no other<br />
A physical manifestation of will

Linking Humanity and its destiny<br />
A shimmering pearl necklace, of cosmic scale?<br />
No; A faint strand of occasional bright flashes, energy released<br />
Dust and micrometeorites chancing into packets of antimatter

As Humanity's future burns brighter, so, too, does its oysters
