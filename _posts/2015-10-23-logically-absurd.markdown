I kinda dislike logical puzzles. They are better described as absurdist creations, with some logical restrictions to give you some kind of challenge. Like the cars puzzle, or those chain/ring things that are all locked together but can be undone or aligned or whatever, or that stupid spherical ball maze thing.

"Why would someone tie up all these rings like this"?
"What kind of valet parks the cars like this"?
"If I tilt this maze just right I ca-NOOOO"

In stark contrast, computers are very much logical creations, but with absurdist restrictions. The quotes below sum it up much better:

"Someone did *what* with Javascript"?!
"Why would C even let you do that."?
"The parenthesis key broke; I didn't plan on editing some Lisp programs anyway."
