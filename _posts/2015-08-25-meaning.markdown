Beware those who found a meaning in our universe, for they will destroy you in the name of that meaning.

But fear most those who accept the absurdity of our universe too easily, for they are as indifferent to you as the universe itself.

Find comfort among those who admit no understanding of our universe, for they are preoccupied with whether anyone would notice if they ate another cookie.
