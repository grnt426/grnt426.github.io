No greater truths need be explored.

Despair! For all things have been revealed, and all nothings overturned. There is no other pursuit or worthy cause, just absolutelyness. For what, you want more? Want not! Know nothing, you know? Know not!

Ramblings of the void, empty is the sanity of the content, of the sure. The twisty, windy, turny, labyrinthine halls of imperatives torn down for the clear.

Levity only fills those whom embark from impatience. Let not wisdom entomb the seekers.
