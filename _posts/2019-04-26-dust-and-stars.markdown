As the dust and light between stars drifts, slowly<br />
It started, as all things do, with many small events
 
In the western middle quadrant three massive<br />
multi-decade good transport ships were lost<br />
To a random gamma ray burst from a dying star<br />
The potential of this loss would not be known for 15 years<br />
The ripples of the loss would become currents over 180 years
 
On the outer-rim of the fourth arm, around the north,<br />
A rebellion had been slowly spiraling outwards to 37 planets<br />
There was no longer an ideal or driving force<br />
For each world that fell, tempted others to the same fate<br />
For 95 years, world after world lost stability and suffered downturns<br />
The markets were of a churning rapids, chaotic
 
The majority of the core sector ring had been entangled<br />
In corruption, graft, mafias, and general lawlessness<br />
Reports and ledgers, debtors and goods lost to<br />
Layers of greed and deceit, no more the metals powerhouse<br />
What once the tides of the galaxy,<br />
now merely a trickle, a stillness
 
In a small, otherwise unremarkable south-eastern quadrant <br />
Expansion efforts were recording increasing losses of new worlds<br />
What boiled down to lost engineering prowess<br />
No more was the age of expansion, some thousands of years ago<br />
And now was the age of dwindling claim<br />
For less profit did each new world bring
 
Usually, isolated, just shifts in <br />
yield on galactic stock indices and bonds<br />
And yet, the ripples of each event, taking decades and centuries<br />
Now conspired against the financial giants of the home sectors
 
These home sectors, fortunes incalculable<br />
Would feel these ripples in the economic fabric, as<br />
The first drops of a storm upon a pond<br />
Each small, but growing, colliding, overlapping<br />
Each crest the stark rise then fall of goods<br />
Food, investments, markets, transports<br />
Kingdoms, democracies, pirates, all
 
The tsunami of economic downturn, now a riptide<br />
The home sector, pulled in to the galactic recession<br />
For centuries, Some feared millennia<br />
To leave only a fractured universe without<br />
Market, political, or cultural center
 
There is no one rain drop<br />
No one crest or trough of the waves<br />
As the dust and light between stars drifts, slowly
